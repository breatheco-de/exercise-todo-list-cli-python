## 🌱  How to start this project

This project comes with the necessary files to start working, but you have two options to start:

a) Open this link in your browser with [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/lesson/what-is-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/lesson/how-to-use-gitpod): https://s.4geeks.com/start?repo=/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list-cli

b) You can clone this repository on your local computer:
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-todo-list-cli
```

### Steps

1. You can test your code by typing: `$ python3 test.py`.
2. You can run your code by typing: `$ python3 app.py`.

These are the functions you will have to implement:

```python
def add_one_task(title):
def print_list():
def delete_task(number_to_delete):
def save_todos():
def load_todos():
```

</onlyfor>
